# Agent Container
The agent container is the container in which the coding agent runs and writes code , execute commands , build things.
so an os with an ai agent (basically a cli tool which can code using an llm) for writing code.
This container should have the setup necessary for coding and project development so that the agent can start working.
So which is the ai agent to be used in this container ? - which can write code and do what needs to be done ?
any existing tools or should i create one ?? 
2 options - 
    1. Gemini CLI 
    or 
    2. TheAgent (the one i am building)


using gemini-cli for now
