# containerized-agent

containerized-agent is a backend system that spins up isolated agent environments inside containers to execute shell commands, run code (Python, TypeScript, etc.), manage files, and control a GUI via xdot. It includes a REST API to schedule tasks, monitor their status, and return results. Designed with sandboxing, scalability, and context management in mind, itâ€™s ideal for building secure coding agents, automation systems, or workflow runners.

## âœ¨ Features

- Run shell and code execution (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
- GUI automation via `xdot` inside a container
- View container in real-time via noVNC
- REST API to schedule tasks and check status
- Context management (beyond token limits)
- Easily extensible, horizontally scalable
- Built with Docker; Firecracker and k8s ready

## ðŸ“¦ API Endpoints

- `POST /schedule`  
  Accepts a task prompt (e.g., "Build a React app") and spawns an agent container/VM.

- `GET /status/:id`  
  Returns the job status and a link to download the final output when ready.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (WIP)

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `docker-compose up --build`  
3. Access the noVNC session at [localhost:6080](http://localhost:6080)  
4. Use the API to schedule jobs and monitor them  

> Note: Ensure Docker is installed and supports GUI containers (X11/VNC).

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- Python (FastAPI or Flask) for orchestration
- Shell subprocesses for command execution
- Jupyter (optional) for code execution
- xdot + Xvfb + noVNC for GUI
- Docker (or Firecracker) for sandboxing
